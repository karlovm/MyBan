# MyBan by karlov_m
Ban and mute system for players with different permissions

Players with different permission group can ban and mute other players for different time.
## Commands and permissions
#### /rban <nickname> <time in minutes> <reason> - ban a player (perms: myban.ban and myban.ban.<time>, myban.banbypass - ignore ban)
#### /runban <nickname>  - unban a player (perms: myban.unban)
#### /rmute <nickname> <time in minutes> <reason> - mute a player (perms: myban.mute and myban.mute.<max time in minutes>, myban.banbypass - ignore mute)
#### /runmute <nickname> - mute a player (perms: myban.unmute)
#### /runmute <nickname> - mute a player (perms: myban.unmute)\
#### /mb reload - reload config
#### /mb save - save current data of muted and banned players (automaticly on disabling)
